# MassSpec_DataAnalysis_MAPsQuantification
This repository includes Python and RStudio code used to analyze MassSpec data coming from a quantification using Peaks for peaks search and MAPDP. The input is an excel file with the quantification sheet, and the output can be an excel file with the number of MAPs recognized by treatment, the CV% using an imputation process with Log2 and the CV% of the data using no imputation. This program should use at least triplicates, as it counts MAPs only if they have a signal in at leas 2 of the 3 replicates.
